        "text": "WHAT: Figure 02 humanoid robot\nCATEGORY: End-to-end neural network\nFEATURES: Trained with reinforcement learning (RL)\nCAPABILITIES: Humanoid locomotion\nSTAGE: End-to-end trained\nLINKS: https://figure.ai/news/reinforcement-learning-walking\nNOTE: The policy learned using RL might converge to sub-optimal control strategies that do not capture the stylistic attributes that define human walking. This includes walking with a human-like gait, with heel-strikes, toe-offs, and arm-swing synchronized with leg movement. The policy is robust to robot-to-robot variations, changes in surface friction, and external pushes, producing repeatable human-like walking across the entire fleet of Figure 02 robots."
